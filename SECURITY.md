## Data Protection
- **Sensitive Data**: Any sensitive information such as personal data, authentication credentials, or confidential project details must be handled securely.
- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables to store sensitive information instead of hardcoding them in the source code.

- **User Authentication**: Use strong authentication methods, such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens), for user sessions.

## Code Security
- **Code Reviews**: All code contributions must undergo a code review process to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies and use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to check for known vulnerabilities.
