## Features

1. **Code Complexity Evaluation**: Assesses the complexity of a candidate's code using metrics such as Cyclomatic Complexity (CC), Weighted Composite Complexity (WCC), and Cognitive Functional Size (CFC).

2. **Code Maintainability Evaluation**: Measures how easy it is to maintain and modify the candidateâ€™s code.

3. **Automated Scoring**: Automatically calculates scores based on complexity and maintainability metrics to help shortlist candidates.
